This repo is the almagamation of my attempt to predict premier league football matches. 
Within the Jupyter notebook I go through the steps in detail, which helped me understand the process better and slowly improve the model.
I also included different analysises of different machine learning models, although I decided to go with SVM in the end.
Overall it was a really interesting project about something I love and managed to achieve 53% accuracy, so fairly chuffed about that (the model predicts a man utd win which unfortunately I dont believe)

I also tried to create a player based model by scraping FIFA player attributes but tis yet to be implemented.
